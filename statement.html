        <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
        <p>So I’m not that good at making artist statements, since most of what I hear is about people giving context about what their art means to them as a whole or describes their process on how they make their art. I’m not really like that, I’m more of a person that likes to make art for the sake of making art. Ever since I was a child, I had always had a liking for art and design, but it's only been since around my last year of High School that I really started to take an interest in making it. The inspiration for my art varies depending on my mood and what interests me at the time that I’m making it. I can’t really say that I have one specific theme that I’m going for in my art, because my interests are constantly changing and I can’t really stick to one certain style since I like to look for new ideas. But if I were forced to answer, I would say that what I would like to get from my art is for people to study what they are looking at, and to make them think. Whenever I look at someone else's art, either at a museum or a school gallery, I like to study the work carefully and to deconstruct its origin. What I mean by that is I want to think about the different factors that went into play when the artist was making their work, and their decisions lead them to make it. For me, art can be very engaging, especially if you think about not just what you see, but also its context and history. There is more meaning to get out of it, even if the art itself has no meaning, it's fun for us to create our own meaning or interpretations of it. That's what I like. And that is also what I try to get out of the audience that views my own work.</p>
        <p>While I do like to draw and paint, and I feel that these mediums still hold strong when it comes to telling a story or expressing an idea. In the realm of digital arts, the possibilities towards what you can accomplish are limitless. Now as for my experiences, it's never really easy starting out in digital arts, since you first need to know what programs you're going to be using and you have to learn the basic functions for each one of them. But once that was done, and I started to get used to it, the opportunities towards what I could do opened up for me. Lately I've been getting into animations since they are moving pictures, so I feel that I can express a lot of ideas using that medium. But overall, my main goal for me as an artist is to make people think and question what they are looking at and for them to think about the meaning behind the art if there is any meaning to be found. But I would prefer for the viewers to look for the answers themselves. I don’t really like giving my artwork descriptions since I feel it takes away the chance for the audience to look around and think for themselves. If I had something to say, I would say it. It wouldn’t feel right to rob someone the chance to study what they see and to think about how it makes them feel or think about it. Or at the very least, make them appreciate the craftsmanship and the time it took for someone to craft something beautiful or expressive. That's what I would hope for.</p>
