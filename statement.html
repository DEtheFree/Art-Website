    <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
    <p>For my works, I had used various mediums to create my works of art because like anything it has to build itself over a period of time and that for me, it's about what I see that really gets me. I take inspiration from looking at the outside world, but I do often get bored just looking at it so I just end up using my imagination to create just old, out of-place and just plain weirdness to try and create some certain images that either look odd for the sake of it, or just creative to look at. Some of the things that I do often put in my works are my love of trains, my passion for films, my love of pop art color and usage, my interest in early 20th century clothing and industry, and on some level, either moral or ethic questions do come into play. A lot of times, when I’m not on my medication to control my ADHD, I often daydream of a better place of my own, where logic makes no sense and the only way to understand the world is to complete ignores the rules and laws of the real word. Where the fashion is way out and the atmosphere is grovey. So I do try and introduce some of my thoughts into these works because since it is a harsh truth that what we make up in our heads will most likely not come true, its best to always create visual representation of that place. </p>
    <p>I did enjoy working on these art projects and had a wonderful time creating them. I would think that I did spend much time on these despite some appearing that it had only taken me about 3 minutes to complete. I am more particular about my compositional art works, I find the style to them more appealing than my other works. One of my works is one titled “Pepperland station”. Without going into to much detail, this piece was the only that I had spent the most time on, out of all the works that I have done for this class. Because I wanted to be as perfect to was I had envisioned as possible. For one example, for each person that is there on the platform of the station, all articles of clothing besides the collar and skin is colored and each piece of clothing is different to each wearer. Another example is how in the picture, where every color is in this weird design and while I had wanted it like that, the truth was that all of the picture was all in black and white, so I had to color everything but with each color being different to the previous. Because if all the colors go by what they have might of looked like, then that become part of the real world, which sucks up all the room for imagination and creativity. And in the end, even though I had wanted to clear in my mind a digital version of pop art, I believe that in terms of flair, it can not be beat.</p>
