      <h3>"It Might be, Interactive/NetArt, 2019</h3>
      <p>I had visited many websight that artist Rafael Rozendaal had created with his simple designed and function, but all surving no vital role in being there. I had spend almost a week trying to understand his concept some much that I had a tab for one of his sights open that I used to go on for about 2 weeks. So when it came time for this, I wanted to do something ver similar, and it came out quite succesful.</p>

      <h3>"Pawesome Furmiliar, 2021</h3>
      <p>This was an early attempt of How to make a video game. This would also be when I would be partnering with someone. Sean Chan is to be given the most credit with his making the machanics of the game while I make the map and sprites. Although you do collect yarn, there is no end to the game, while do to lack of time, we did end up more about how to make a playable game.</p>
