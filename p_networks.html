      <h3>"It Might be, Interactive/NetArt, 2019</h3>
      <p>I had visited many websight that artist Rafael Rozendaal had created with his simple designed and function, but all surving no vital role in being there. I had spend almost a week trying to understand his concept some much that I had a tab for one of his sights open that I used to go on for about 2 weeks. So when it came time for this, I wanted to do something ver similar, and it came out quite succesful. .</p>
