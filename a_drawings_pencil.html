      <h2>Tower</h2>
      <h3>Pencil on Paper, 2016</h3>
      <p>One of the earliest drawings that I made during my third year of High School. Staring out the window looking at a church, admiring it's architecture I ended up with my interpretation of the dome that was fixed atop the church.

      <p>An early work, during a time that I was very fond of the musican, Chopin. I was copying a charcoal portrait of him but adding my own style which was to draw his face but with my pencil strokes going only in one direction.</p>

      <h3>Pencil on Paper, 2017</h3>
      <p>I'm a big fan of trains ever since I was a child, and I've always liked how they looked, moved and functioned. I drew this as I was listening to a music piece that gave me an image of a train racing across an unsteady bridge.</p>
