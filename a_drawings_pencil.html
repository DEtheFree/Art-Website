      <h3>Untitled, Drawing, 2016 </h3>
      <p>One of the earliest drawings that I made during my third year of High School. Staring out the window looking at a church, admiring it's architecture I ended up with my interpretation of the dome that was fixed atop the church.

      <h3>Frédéric Chopin Portrait, Drawing, 2017 </h3>
      <p>An early work, during a time that I was very fond of the musican, Chopin. I was copying a charcoal portrait of him but adding my own style which was to draw his face but with my pencil strokes going only in one direction.</p>

      <h3>Untitled, Drawing, 2017 </h3>
      <p>I'm a big fan of trains ever since I was a child, and I've always liked how they looked, moved and functioned. I drew this as I was listening to a music piece that gave me an image of a train racing across an unsteady bridge.</p>

      <h3>Wanderer in Flower Field, Drawing, 2018</h3>
      <p>Around my college campus, there was an abundance of roses. I went on walks and imagine that I was in a field full of roses with some growing into larger flowers and thick vines.</p>
