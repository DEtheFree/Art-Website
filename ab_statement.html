        <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
        <p>For my art, the purpose for what I make is in a more broader context, yet is somewhat personal to me. It is a goal of mine to have each work be unique in its presentation, being different from my previous work. Yet, while my art does differ in style and design, I am more focused on creating some type of genre or narrative. In each drawing or painting, while there is a level of abstraction presented in some of my work, I make an attempt to add a story to it. I find that in art when there is narrative, people often tend to look at the art for a longer period of time rather than if it was something more complex or abstract. I am quite fascinated and attracted to the allure of pattern and designs. The way they look and the way they draw you in, making you look at them more closely, seeing more designs and patterns within the initial one. I explore patterns as a way of inviting the viewer to look more closely, to take a deeper look at what they are seeing, and to consider how they all connect with the rules of mathematics and geometry. This is something I find quite extraordinary. The goal of my work would be to have the viewer gain something when they stare into them. I would like them to have some kind of an experience. I would like them to scan the image and to take a deeper look at what they are seeing. Some of my drawings have a lot of patterns, designs and detail, because like the real world, they are full of repeating patterns and complex designs that we see on a daily basis but haven’t really got the time to stop and observe the thing we see around us.</p>
        <h1>Bio</h1>
        <p>Diego Esparza is an artist that works in both pictorial and digital works, mainly in drawing, painting, video art and photography. He says that his works are “a mix of different themes or ideas depending on his mood at the moment”. Originally majoring in computer science, he switched over to digital media art as a major but still likes to draw by hand using pencil and paper. Although he says that he doesn’t really have a theme to his work, there are very similar imagery and themes going on within his work. Very often, he tends to focus on detail, mainly focusing on ornate patterns and designs. Diego switches from different types of drawing mediums from representational to abstractions, but more often than not, most of his works revolve around modern contemporary themes or current political events or his own personal experiences.</p>
