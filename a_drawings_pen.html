      <p>Taken from the cover of William Basiski's album, The Disintigration Loops. In it, it show what appears to be a girl in a white dress with her shoulder puffed out and cropped at the far left. As well as how the clouds looked blending with the buildings in the background.</p>

      <h3>Monks in search of Faith, Drawing, 2020 </h3>
      <p>A quick gift to a distant aunt that I had made the night before she was about to leave. She is a devoted catholic, so I thought to draw her something that wasn't based around faith in a catholic sense but faith as an idea. Also inspried after seeing the 1966 film, Andrei Rublev. </p>
