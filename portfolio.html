      <h3>A Plinths of Pics, Digital Art/Pop Art, 2019</h3>
      <p>I didn't really know what to call this piece but for now I'll go with "A Plinths of Pics" since the picture already odd and makes no sense which makes the best sense. This work I feel is still a work in progress since while there is many odd figures in the picture, it still needs more until the place is unrecognisable. I started the idea with influence of Terry Gilliams work with Monty Python so I wan't to recreate it at the best I could. As a group we decided to pick a city to be our scene and I chose Amsterdam since it looked so picturesque.</p>
