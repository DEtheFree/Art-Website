      <h3>Glitchme, Digital Art, 2019</h3>
      <p>This was my first major piece of digital art.  While at first I was less than enthusiastic about the work I ended up being pleased with the result because when looking at the orignal photo then looking at it's glitched version, I found the expericence very enjoyable.</p>

      <h3>A Plinths of Pics, Digital Art/Pop Art, 2019</h3>
      <p>This piece is still a work in progress until the scene is unrecognizable. I was influenced by Terry Gilliam's paper cut animations that tend to make no sense.  I wanted to recreate it at the best I could. As a group we decided to pick a city to be our scene and I chose Amsterdam since it looked so picturesque.</p>

      <h3>Chatter, Sound Art, 2019</h3>
      <p>This was the first sound project that I created. I wanted the sound to be calm at first but eventully grow to be loud and chaotic, despite being limited to the sounds that were avalible around my school.</div>

      <h3>Pepperland Station, Composite Art, 2019</h3>
      <p>I made this piece because I had always loved steam locomotives and had recently watched the Beatle's film, Yellow Submarine. The original photo was in black and white, and I liked the idea of coloring the picture in my own style with bright colores and decorative patterns.</p>

      <h3>Boogaloo Update, Composite Art, 2019</h3>
      <p>I have always loved playing Team Fortress 2, and in the game, there are these built in cosmetics (in this case hats). During one update, they added several new robotic versions of these pre-existing cosmetics. I wanted to have the cosmetics, but since I didn't want to spend the money on something virtual, I decied to make my own work using the same kind of hats that I would have liked to have. </p>

      <h3>La vita alta, Composite Art, 2019</h3>
      <p>In the cartoon "Bugs Bunny Rides Again",we are introduced to Yosemite Sam for the first time. There's a scene where Sam says to Bugs, "This town ain't big enough for the two of us", and Bugs says, "it ain't?" then immediately runs out of the saloon with some wooden boards and a hammer, he's off screen for about 5 seconds with the sounds of hammering, sawing and drilling, comes back and says to Sam "is it big enough now?". The scene then cuts to the small western town but now having skyscrapers in the background. I liked the idea of of building up an image with different images. </p>

      <h3>Beyond the tile, Hyper-reality art, 2020</h3>
      <h4> Requires Blippar app, Test Code:146174</h4>
      <p>A while back I became very obsessed with patterns, mainly patterns found within tiles. So I decided to used some of the footage I had from my previous projects to create something that was hypnotizing and interactive. </p>
