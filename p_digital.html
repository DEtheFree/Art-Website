      <h3>Glitchme, Digital Art, 2019</h3>
      <p>This was the first major piece of digital art that I had done, which I wasn't not really enthusiastic about it at first. But after seeing how it had came out, I ws very pleased with it, because when I was looking at the orignal photo then looking at it's gliched version, I found the expericance very enjoyable.</p>

      <h3>A Plinths of Pics, Digital Art/Pop Art, 2019</h3>
      <p>I didn't really know what to call this piece but for now I'll go with "A Plinths of Pics" since the picture already odd and makes no sense which makes the best sense. This work I feel is still a work in progress since while there is many odd figures in the picture, it still needs more until the place is unrecognisable. I started the idea with influence of Terry Gilliams work with Monty Python so I wan't to recreate it at the best I could. As a group we decided to pick a city to be our scene and I chose Amsterdam since it looked so picturesque.</p>

      <h3>Chatter, Sound Art, 2019</h3>
      <p>In my mind I wanted to make it so the sound would get prgressivaly more caotic with sounds, but due to limitations and errors, I came up with this. The sounds that I had aquired were nice but I felt as though if i had know what effects to used, it would have been the same except in a certain fromat</p>

      <h3>Pepperland Station, Composite Art, 2019</h3>
      <p>I Remember when I had first watch the Beatle's film, Yellow Submarine, I couldn't help myself to be amazed about the art style. It was so vibrant with many different colors, and it didn't matter which color matched or was to vibrant, and all hand drawn not looking for detail. Now I know that is most common form of pop art who I had previously hated until i had understood it's concept. I made this piece because I had always loved steam locomotives with visible pistons and the connection rods and plus I wanted to add color when it was only monochrome. All of this was originally black and white so I added different colors to each different article of clothing, also there was no smoke so I added that mixed in with some wild patterns.</p>

      <h3>Boogaloo Update, Composite Art, 2019</h3>
      <p>So I have always loved playing Team Fortress 2, and in the game, there are these built in cosmetics. During one update, they added serval new robotic versions of pre-exsiting cosmetics. So since I wanted to have them but didn't want to spend the money on something virtual, I decied to make my own work using the same kind of hats that I would have liked to have. Making it so that I would have these hats as a sort of collection for something that looked cool. but for a digital game.</p>

      <h3>La vita alta, Composite Art, 2019</h3>
      <p>In the cartoon "Bugs Bunny Rides again",we are introduced to Yosemite Sam for the first time. There's a scene where Sam says to Bugs, "This town ain't big enough for the two of us", and Bugs is to say, "it ain't?" then immediately runs out of the saloon with some wooden boards and a hammer, he's off screen for about 5 seconds with the sounds of hammering, sawing and drilling, comes back and says to Sam "is it big enough now?". It then cuts to the small western town but now having skyscrapers in the background. I though that was hilarious growing up, and I had like that of things not making sense to prove a point. It also reminded me of the works of Federico Fellini, manly his comedy/drama "8 1/2". So I mixed the types of building around to see what would look the most surreal. </p>

      <h3>Beyond the tile, Hyper-reality art, 2020</h3>
      <h4> Requires Blippar app, Test Code:146174</h4>
      <p>A while back I became very obsessed with patterns, mainly patterns found within tiles. So I decided to used some of the footage I had from my previous projects to create something with. So I wanted to making something that was hypnotizing and interactive. </p>
