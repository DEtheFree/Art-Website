      <h3>Glitchme, Digital Art, 2019</h3>
      <p>This was the first major piece of digital art that I did, which at first, I was not really enthusiastic about. However, after seeing how it came out, I was very pleased, because when ooking at the orignal photo then looking at it's glitched version, I found the expericance very enjoyable.</p>

      <h3>A Plinths of Pics, Digital Art/Pop Art, 2019</h3>
      <p>I didn't really know what to call this piece but for now I'll go with "A Plinths of Pics" since the picture is already odd and makes no sense which makes the best sense. This work I feel is still a work in progress. While there are many odd figures in the picture, it still needs more until the place is unrecognizable. I was influenced by Terry Gilliam's animations, so I wanted to recreate it at the best I could. As a group we decided to pick a city to be our scene and I chose Amsterdam since it looked so picturesque.</p>

      <h3>Chatter, Sound Art, 2019</h3>
      <p>In my mind I wanted to make it so the sound would get progressively more chaotic, but due to limitations and errors, I came up with this. The sounds that I recorde were nice but I felt as though if I had known what effects to use, it would have been the same except in a certain format</p>

      <h3>Pepperland Station, Composite Art, 2019</h3>
      <p>I Remember when I first watched the Beatle's film, Yellow Submarine, I couldn't help myself but be amazed about the art style. It was so vibrant with many different colors, and it didn't matter which color matched or was vibrant, and all hand drawn not looking for detail. Now I know that style is the most common form of pop art that I previously hated until I understood its concept. I made this piece because I had always loved steam locomotives with visible pistons and the connection rods plus I wanted to add color when it was only monochrome. All of this was originally black and white so I added different colors to each different article of clothing, also there was no smoke so I added that mixed in with some wild patterns.</p>

      <h3>Boogaloo Update, Composite Art, 2019</h3>
      <p>So I have always loved playing Team Fortress 2, and in the game, there are these built in cosmetics (in this case hats). During one update, they added several new robotic versions of these pre-existing cosmetics. I wanted to have the cosmetics, but since I didn't want to spend the money on something virtual, I decied to make my own work using the same kind of hats that I would have liked to have. </p>

      <h3>La vita alta, Composite Art, 2019</h3>
      <p>In the cartoon "Bugs Bunny Rides again",we are introduced to Yosemite Sam for the first time. There's a scene where Sam says to Bugs, "This town ain't big enough for the two of us", and Bugs is to say, "it ain't?" then immediately runs out of the saloon with some wooden boards and a hammer, he's off screen for about 5 seconds with the sounds of hammering, sawing and drilling, comes back and says to Sam "is it big enough now?". It then cuts to the small western town but now having skyscrapers in the background. I though that was hilarious growing up, and I had like that of things not making sense to prove a point. It also reminded me of the works of Federico Fellini, manly his comedy/drama "8 1/2". So I mixed the types of building around to see what would look the most surreal. </p>

      <h3>Beyond the tile, Hyper-reality art, 2020</h3>
      <h4> Requires Blippar app, Test Code:146174</h4>
      <p>A while back I became very obsessed with patterns, mainly patterns found within tiles. So I decided to used some of the footage I had from my previous projects to create something with. So I wanted to making something that was hypnotizing and interactive. </p>
