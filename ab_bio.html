        <p>Diego Esparza is an artist that works in both pictorial and digital works, mainly in drawing, painting, video art and photography. He says that his works are “a mix of different themes or ideas depending on his mood at the moment”. Originally majoring in computer science, he switched over to digital media art as a major but still likes to draw by hand using pencil and paper. Although he says that he doesn’t really have a theme to his work, there are very similar imagery and themes going on within his work. Very often, he tends to focus on detail, mainly focusing on ornate patterns and designs. Diego switches from different types of drawing mediums from representational to abstractions, but more often than not, most of his works revolve around modern contemporary themes or current political events or his own personal experiences.</p>
