      <h3>Walkman, Video Art, 2019</h3>
      <p>An assinment that I did that came out pretty well if I do say so myself. Video and sound had to be original but with no one to assinst me in filming, certain scenes that I wanted to film were impossible, so I stuck to what I could do. The editing was a bit of a hassel but filming was difficult since for a certain shoots, I was fraid that someone would call the police on me.</p>

      <h3>Morph, Video Art, 2020</h3>
      <p>
        One of the first video projects that I have done. I took an image of clouds which had been colored in blues and golds, and then I made multiples of the same image but with different perspectives until all the images morphed together. The idea came to me when I was thinking about how images moved when under the influence of psychedelics.

      <h3>Video Installation, Video Art, 2020</h3>
      <p>
        Some early work that I had done using some video editing software that wasn't Premier Pro. I got the idea from watching the music video "Someday" by Wevel, in which it show various mundane objects being spun in a circle until it turned into a morphed imaged showing various patterns. So I decided to use tiles as my images to use and made them move clockwise until the tile becomes a moving picture.
