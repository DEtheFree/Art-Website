      <h3>Walkman, Video Art, 2019</h3>
      <p>An assinment that I did that came out pretty well if I do say so myself. Video and sound had to be original but with no one to assinst me in filming, certain scenes that I wanted to film were impossible, so I stuck to what I could do. The editing was a bit of a hassel but filming was difficult since for a certain shoots, I was fraid that someone would call the police on me.</p>

      <h3>Morph, Video Art, 2020</h3>
      <p>
        One of the first video projects that I have done. I took an image of clouds which had been colored in blues and golds, and then I made multiples of the same image but with different perspectives until all the images morphed together. The idea came to me when I was thinking about how images moved when under the influence of psychedelics.

      <h3>Video Installation, Video Art, 2020</h3>
      <p>
        Some early work that I had done using some video editing software that wasn't Premier Pro. I got the idea from watching the music video "Someday" by Wevel, in which it show various mundane objects being spun in a circle until it turned into a morphed imaged showing various patterns. So I decided to use tiles as my images to use and made them move clockwise until the tile becomes a moving picture.

      <h3>Enhancement, Video Art, 2020</h3>
      <h4>Note: This video as rapid cuts. Do not watch if prone to seizures.</h4>
      <p>A video made using unused footage from a previous project. It's called enhancement after I read somewhere that seeing to images being displayed at the same time forces the brain to use both hemispheres. So in a sense, it enhancese your brain's ability to use both sides.</p>

      <h3>Gregior, Animation, 2020</h3>
      <p>This was a project that I had made after I had spent the month of july teaching myself how to animate using Adobe Animate. I made all the animation, music and sound all by myself using only my mouse to draw everything. I didn't have mush of an idea what the video would be about, but it is just me testing to see the ablilites that I could do with animation. But I'm please on the results.</p>

      <h3>The Xtal Project, Video Art, 2020</h3>
      <p>
       A music video for Aphex Twin for a video project I was working on for school. Even though most of music videos for Aphex Twin have video footage of cloulds, I wanted to make something that both incorperates clouds but also editing the footage to make it less and less recognizabe at the end.

      <h3>Zoom, 3D Animation, 2020</h3>
      <p>
       One of the first video animations that I made using the 3D program Maya. the rendering time took longer than expected so I had to make do with the amount of footage I had. All of the sounds were made by me, exceot for the alarm. I wanted to make soemthing the expresses my feeling of leanring through zoom.</p>

      <h3>The Arival of this, Video Art, 2020</h3>
      <p>This was a school project that I had made using After Effects. I have always liked looking at the video work of Cyriak Harris and I wanted to figure out just how he made his videos. I esspecially liked his worked when he used old footage. So I used the footage, L'arriv√©e d'un train en gare de La Ciotat. The work wasn't easy and often repeditive since I had to make sure that all parts of the train were shown, which is hard to do when your footage is old and grainy.</p>

      <h3>3D World, 3D Animation, 2020</h3>
      <p>A little animated short that I using Maya. I though about how someone could create a world all inside a 3D modeling program, and imagined what it would be like if someone in the program became aware of the world that he is placed in. seeing how everthing around him has been made using simple geometric shapes.</p>
