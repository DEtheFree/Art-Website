      <h3>Morph, Video Art, 2020</h3>
      <p>In this video project I took an image of clouds which had been colored in blues and golds, and then I made multiples of the same image but with different perspectives until all the images morphed together. The idea came to me as I was imagining how images moved when under the influence of psychedelics.</p>

      <h3>Video Installation, Video Art, 2020</h3>
      <p>This early work uses video editing software other than Premier Pro. I got the idea from watching the music video "Someday" by Wevel, in which it shows various mundane objects being spun in a circle until it turned into a morphed image. I decided to use tiles as my images and made them move clockwise until the tiles became a moving picture.</p>

      <h3>Enhancement, Video Art, 2020</h3>
      <h4>Note: This video has rapid cuts. Do not watch if prone to seizures.</h4>
      <p>A video made using unused footage from a previous project. It's called "Enhancement" after I read that seeing two images being displayed at the same time forces the brain to use both hemispheres. In a sense, it enhancese your brain's ability to use both sides.</p>

      <h3>Gregior, Animation, 2020</h3>
      <p>I created this animation after teaching myself Adobe Animate. I made all the animation, music and sound using only my mouse to draw everything. I didn't have much of an idea what the video would be about, but it was mostly a way to test my animation ablilites.</p>

      <h3>The Xtal Project, Video Art, 2020</h3>
      <p>
       A music video for Aphex Twin for a school video project. Even though most of music videos for Aphex Twin have video footage of cloulds, I wanted to make something that both incorporates clouds but also edited the footage to make it less and less recognizabe at the end.

      <h3>Zoom, 3D Animation, 2020</h3>
      <p>
       One of the first video animations that I made using the 3D program Maya. The rendering time took longer than expected so I made due with the limited footage available. All of the sounds were made by me, except for the alarm. I wanted to make soemthing that expresses my feeling of learning through zoom.</p>

      <h3>The Arival of this, Video Art, 2020</h3>
      <p>This school project was made using After Effects. I have always liked looking at the video work of Cyriak Harris and I wanted to figure out just how he made his videos. I especially liked his work when he used old film footage. In keeping with this style, I used the footage, "L'arriv√©e d'un train en gare de La Ciotat".</p>

      <h3>3D World, 3D Animation, 2020</h3>
      <p>A little animated short using Maya. I thought about how someone could create a world all inside a 3D modeling program. I imagined what it would be like if someone in the program became self-aware seeing how everthing around him has been made using simple geometric shapes.</p>
