      <h3>Untitled, Drawing, 2016 </h3>
      <p>One of the earliest drawing that I had made during my third year of High School. One day, when I was bored, I stared out of the window looking at a church, admiring it's architexture. So I ended up turning my homeword assignment over as started drawing my interpretaion of the dome that was fixed atop the church. </p>

      <h3>Frédéric Chopin Portrait, Drawing, 2017 </h3>
      <p>An early work, during a time that I was very fond of the musican, Chopin. I was coping over a charcole portrait of him but adding my own style which was to draw his face but with my pencil strokes going only in one direction.</p>

      <h3>Untitled, Drawing, 2017 </h3>
      <p>I'm a big fan of trains ever since I was a child, and I've always liked how they looked, moved and functioned. I drew this one day when I was listen to a music piece that gave me an image of a train racing across an unsteady brigde.</p>
