      <h3>Untitled, Drawing, 2016 </h3>
      <p>One of the earliest drawing that I had made during my third year of High School. One day, when I was bored, I stared out of the window looking at a church, admiring it's architexture. So I ended up turning my homeword assignment over as started drawing my interpretaion of the dome that was fixed atop the church. </p>

      <h3>Frédéric Chopin Portrait, Drawing, 2017 </h3>
      <p>An early work, during a time that I was very fond of the musican, Chopin. I was coping over a charcoal portrait of him but adding my own style which was to draw his face but with my pencil strokes going only in one direction.</p>

      <h3>Untitled, Drawing, 2017 </h3>
      <p>I'm a big fan of trains ever since I was a child, and I've always liked how they looked, moved and functioned. I drew this one day when I was listen to a music piece that gave me an image of a train racing across an unsteady brigde.</p>

      <h3>Stream of Conscientious, Drawing, 1/4/20 </h3>
      <p>While on acid, I decided to see what I would try to draw. I can tell you what I was seeing or thinking. All I can say that there was a sense of everything being connected in someway.</p>

      <h3>Monks in search of Faith, Drawing, 2020 </h3>
      <p>A quick gift to a distant aunt that I had made the night before she was about to leave. She is a devoted catholic, so I thought to draw her something that wasn't based around faith in a catholic sense but faith as an idea. Also inspried after seeing the 1966 film, Andrei Rublev. </p>

      <h3>Bell (B/W & color), Painting, 2020 </h3>
      <p>A painting for a school assinment where we had to try our skills in painting in monochrome and color. I though about how the minds works and how we think of imagination. So making the sense take place on this surreal island where these tree's holding this giant bell made sense to me.</p>
